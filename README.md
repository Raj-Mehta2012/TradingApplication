# TradingApplication
The Trading Application project focuses on predicting future values of financial indicators, such as stock prices, using historical data. This kind of project is particularly interesting because it combines data processing, analysis, and machine learning to extract insights and make predictions about financial markets. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how you can leverage AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, AWS SageMaker, and Spark/Hive for this project, followed by a proposed architecture.

## Project Overview
### Objective: To forecast future values of financial indicators using historical time series data.
How You Will Use These Technologies:
* 		AWS S3:
    - Purpose: Store historical financial time series data, such as stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant financial indicators. S3 will serve as the central data lake for raw and processed data.
* 		AWS Glue:
    - Purpose: Use Glue for data cataloging and as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service to prepare and transform the raw financial data into a structured format suitable for analysis. AWS Glue can automate the process of data discovery, classification, and preparation for analysis.
* 		Spark/Hive on AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce):
    - Purpose: Perform large-scale data processing and analysis on the structured data. You can use Spark for its fast in-memory computing capabilities and Hive for managing and querying structured data. This step is crucial for feature engineering, which involves creating new features from raw data that can help improve the model's predictions.
* 		AWS Lambda:
    - Purpose: Automate workflows, such as triggering the ETL jobs in AWS Glue based on new data arrivals in S3 or invoking model re-training in SageMaker when updated datasets are available. Lambda can serve as the orchestrator for various data processing and machine learning workflows, ensuring that your forecasting models are always trained on the most recent data.
* 		AWS SageMaker:
    - Purpose: Build, train, and deploy machine learning models for time series forecasting. SageMaker provides various built-in algorithms and supports custom models, making it a versatile platform for developing forecasting models. You can experiment with different algorithms, such as ARIMA, LSTM networks, or Prophet, to find the best fit for your financial data.

## Implementation
Implementation Steps:
* 		Data Ingestion: Automatically ingest historical financial data into S3 buckets.
* 		Data Preparation and ETL: Use AWS Glue for ETL jobs to transform raw data into a clean, structured format. The AWS Glue Data Catalog can organize this data for easy access.
* 		Feature Engineering: Use Spark/Hive on AWS EMR to perform feature engineering, creating new features that could help improve the accuracy of your forecasts.
* 		Model Training and Evaluation: Use AWS SageMaker to train and evaluate forecasting models. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model.
* 		Deployment and Inference: Deploy the trained model on SageMaker for real-time or batch predictions.
* 		Automation and Orchestration: Use AWS Lambda to orchestrate the workflow, including data ingestion, ETL processes, feature engineering, and triggering model re-training when new data is available.
